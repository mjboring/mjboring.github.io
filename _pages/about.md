Sighted humans often take for granted how effortlessly we can recognize the objects in our surroundings. Very complex patterns of light that enter our retinas are quickly translated into meaningful concepts which we use to guide our behavior. For example, we can easily glance at the red, shiney sphere on our kitchen counter and bite into it, confident that it is indeed an apple. However, there are people with 20/20 vision that have a much more difficult time recognizing the objects around them. These people, which have usually suffered from brain damage, suffer from agnosia, which prevents them from recognizing objects through sight although they can still see the world around them.
