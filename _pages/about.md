We often take for granted how effortlessly we can recognize the objects in our surroundings. Very complex patterns of light that enter our retinas are quickly translated into meaningful concepts which we use to guide most of our behaviors. For example, we can easily glance at the red, shiny sphere on our kitchen counter and bite into it, confident that it is an apple. However, there are people with completely normal vision that have a much more difficult time recognizing the objects around them. These people, which have usually experienced brain damage, suffer from agnosia, which prevents them from recognizing objects through sight.

During my graduate studies I have worked towards understanding how the visual system allows us to effortlessly recognize and find objects around us. In [my lab](http://www.lcnd.pitt.edu/), we analyze recordings collected directly from the human brain to understand what information is contained in different brain regions and how this information changes during rapid visual recognition. This has lead us to some interesting findings regarding the spatial organization of regions that selectively respond to different objects in the environment as well as how different regions process visual information through time. Recently, I have been working to understand how people process more natural visual environments, which contain many objects. Through this work, I hope to understand how we are able to quickly locate objects around us.
