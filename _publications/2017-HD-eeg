title: "Very high density EEG elucidates spatiotemporal aspects of early visual processing"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper we investigated whether electroencephalography systems [EEG] with higher density sensor arrays allowed us to non-invasively record more information from the brain. We found higher density systems captured more information than current state-of-the-art systems.'
