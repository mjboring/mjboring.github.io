excerpt: 'Many studies have investigated how the brain reacts to changes in mental effort. However, most of those studies have restricted their investigations to very limited experimental contexts. In this study we use machine learning to predict how much mental effort a person is under given EEG activity across a variety of tasks. This represents a step forward for brain-computer interfaces and human-computer interaction systems that adapt computer behavior based on non-invasively recorded neural activity.'
