excerpt: 'In this work we sought to determine if magnetoencephalography [MEG] data preprocessing techniques were effective at cleansing magnetic artifacts induced by deep brain stimulating [DBS] electrodes. By comparing information contained in recordings collected from DBS patients and healthy controls we concluded that they were effective. This quantitatively demonstrated the efficacy of these techniques and opens the door for future studies investigating the effects of DBS using MEG.'
